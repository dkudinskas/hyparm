LINUX KERNEL:

The config file is checked into the repository. The kernel version used is a 2.6.28.1 release version, download link
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.28.1.tar.bz2

U-Boot uses a specific kernel image format called uImage. Such image can be built from a kernel source tree using the uImage target. It is prepared from the kernel ELF binary (vmlinuz) using a series of scripts, of which some are well hidden (dot-files):

1. The kernel ELF binary vmlinuz is compressed to arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux

2. A zImage is created using the arch/arm/boot/.zImage.cmd script:
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .note.gnu.build-id -R .comment -S arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux arch/arm/boot/zImage

3. A uImage is created from the zImage using the arch/arm/boot/.uImage.cmd script, which in turn calls scripts/mkuboot.sh. The latter resolves the location of the mkimage binary, and calls it to create the actual uImage:
mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x80008000 -e 0x80008000 -n 'Linux-2.6.28.1' -d arch/arm/boot/zImage arch/arm/boot/uImage

You can manually build a uImage from an uncompressed kernel:

1. Build an Image file:
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .note.gnu.build-id -R .comment -S vmlinux arch/arm/boot/Image
2. Invoke mkimage on the Image file instead:
mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x80008000 -e 0x80008000 -n 'Linux-2.6.28.1' -d arch/arm/boot/Image arch/arm/boot/uImage 


COMPILING THE HYPERVISOR:

A cross-compiler toolchain is required for building the hypervisor. It must be set using the CROSS_COMPILE variable, either from the environment, or as part of the command line to make.

The hypervisor supports compiling for multiple "targets", which can be set using the TARGET variable. A target is an abstract concept that refers to:
- the physical platform the hypervisor is built for;
- a set of compile-time options.

Currently, the following targets are supported:
- beagle: build for the BeagleBoard (based on TI OMAP3530);
- beagle-autodecoder: same as the above, but use an optimized (auto-generated) instruction decoder.

The following targets are incomplete and non-functional:
- tegra250

Typical example of how to set CROSS_COMPILE and TARGET:
export CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/arm-none-eabi-4.4/bin/arm-none-eabi-
make TARGET=beagle-autodecoder

Each target has a corresponding target_name.config file in the build directory. Targets can be edited by manipulating their respective .config files; new targets may also be created by creating new .config files for them. No changes to the Makefile are required.

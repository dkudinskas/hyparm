This is what's needed to build and run a kernel with initrd.

The initial ramdisk is compressed and provided. The kernel config is as well. Notable switches:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE=""
making sure source does not point to anything, initrd is external from the built linux kernel, and has to be transferred to memory parallel with the linux kernel. 

CONFIG_CMDLINE="console=ttyS2,115200n8 ramdisk_size=8192 root=/dev/ram0 rw rootfstype=ext2 initrd=0x81600000,8M nohz=Off"
Kernel command line now is pretty informative. As in any DISK, the kernel knows how big the disk is. So initial ramDISK wouldnt be a disk if it didn't have a 'size', in this case, 8 megabytes. Also, disk must have a partition with a fyle system, so we must tell that as well. Since it's external, linux must know where to look for initrd and what area in memory it occupies.


If you want to edit the ramdisk:
1. make a new mountpoint (mkdir initrdmount)
2. mount the uncompressed! initrd (mount -o loop initrd ./initrdmount)
3. edit, then unmount, and gzip the initrd again.

Now make sure you don't put more stuff than there is space on disk (8 megabytes)! or things will go horribly wrong.


If you think 8 megabytes is too much (and virtualized linux takes tooooo long setting them up), you can build a smaller initrd, but you would have to do it from scratch.

1. dd a new file or required size - take 4MB as example.
dd if=/dev/zero of=initrd bs=4M count=16
2. mke2fs will build a file system into the file. 
mke2fs -F -m 0 -b 4096 ./initrd

now you can mount the file.
make a new folder structure. 
mkdir bin dev etc lib proc sbin var

.. and copy at least /dev/null and /dev/console into your new initrd.
cp -a /dev/null ./initrdmount/dev/
cp -a /dev/console ./initrdmount/dev/

.. also, make sure there is an init to execute. like busybox's /bin/sh.

once you are done, unmount, and compress.

REMEMBER: if you build an initrd of different size, dont forget to change your CONFIG_CMDLINE parameters when rebuilding your kernel to reflect new size!!!

eclipse-code-formatter-profile.xml

  An Eclipse code formatter profile that enforces most of the formatting
  rules used in the hypervisor C source files. Use this profile when
  editing those files with Eclipse. Do not use this to reformat entire C
  files, as not all of our rules can be expressed in terms of an Eclipse
  code formatter profile.

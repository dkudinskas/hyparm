this is a simple trampoline to boot linux native but enable counters beforehand.


BUILD ELF:
arm-none-eabi-gcc booter.c callKernel.S image.c loader.c -o booter -mcpu=cortex-a8

MAKE BINARY:
arm-none-eabi-objcopy booter booter.bin 

RUNNING:
transfer booter to RAM
loady 8f000000

find _start address in objdump (like 0x80d4)
jump to _start, for example
go 8f0080d4

<h1>ARMv7-A memory management</h1>

<p>The ARMv7-A architecture provides an MMU which supports paged virtual memory. The MMU is accessed through the registers of the system control coprocessor (CP15).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The processor and its caches operate on virtual addresses. When the MMU is enabled, it will translate virtual addresses to physical addresses. Translation tables map regions of virtual addresses onto regions of physical addresses.</p>

<p>For each mapped region, translation tables also contain access permissions and a domain field.
There are 16 possible domains. Each domain has 2 bits in the domain access control register (DACR).
Depending on these bits, memory accesses to regions of a particular domain may be allowed or disallowed unconditionally, or may depend on the access permissions specific to the region.
Domains allow privileged code to alter the protection of a large number of regions at once, given that they are in the same domain.
The access permissions determine whether memory can be read or written, and whether accesses are restricted to privileged code or may also happen from unprivileged code.</p>

<p>Translation tables also control whether regions can be cached or not.</p>

<h2>Translation tables</h2>

<p>A translation table is a sequence of descriptors. There are two levels of translation tables: L1 and L2. An L1 table contains descriptors for supersections, sections, and L2 tables. Each L1 descriptor maps 1 MB of memory. An L2 table contains descriptors for large and small pages. An entire L2 table maps as much as one L1 descriptor. Each L2 descriptor maps 4 kB of memory.</p>

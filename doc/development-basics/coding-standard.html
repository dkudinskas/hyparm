<h1>Coding standard</h1>

<p>
These are the coding standard rules. Many places in current code might breach them. If you find such place and have time, tidy it up.
</p>

<ol>

<li>Functions, variables, types in <code>typedef</code>s start with non-capital letters, and are written in non-capital (with exceptions in rule 2). <code>#define</code>'d macros are all in capitals.</li>

<li>No underscores in variable or function names. Use capital letters to separate words instead (not <code>function_name</code> but <code>functionName</code>). Use underscores only to separate words in <code>#define</code>'d macros (e.g. <code>#define MY_MACRO_NAME</code>).</li>

<li>Use common <code>typedef</code>'d types (<code>u32int</code> instead of <code>unsigned int</code>).</li>

<li>No function bodies in header files.</li>

<li>
Use curly brackets everywhere, don't skip them where optional in control statements. Curly brackets are always in their own line, e.g.:
<pre>
if (condition)
{
  /* one or more LoC */
}
</pre>
</li>

<li>Use longer variable names if needed, but make them logical. Try not to name variables as acronyms, or undecodable text combinations. (<code>u32int uloina</code> is absolutely horrible, <code>u32int upLimitOfUnsIntArray</code> is long, but it's still better).</li>

<li>Try to break lines into two where needed, avoid excessively long lines of code.</li>

<li>Avoid "magic numbers". Try to <code>#define</code> them if they are needed. If they are not needed, they should not be there.</li>

<li>Add more rules if they are sensible, and will help keep the codebase clean...</li>

</ol>

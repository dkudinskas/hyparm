define BLOCK_COPY_DEBUG

when raising exception in guest, make sure LR is correct!!!

problems occur for ex when rewriting PUSH ..-PC
we can isolate the PC case in a separate PUSH, however
- PUSH will not abort on an unaligned address with one register , even though PUSH with multiple will
- the extra PUSH pc may abort while the rest may not... the guest has to see this as an abort on the original STM!!!

more crap with the generic STM!!!
